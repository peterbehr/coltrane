Welcome! Coltrane is the working title that has only been worked on for a few days, and I'm not sure what it'll be yet. But there is a bit of code, so we're putting it here.



# Setup

This uses `nodemon` and in production `forever`, `jade` for templates.



# How

Usually for development:

	$ nodemon app.js

But you might also want to try:

	$ forever start app.js
